## I have implemented this project based on the tutorials 1-7 from the Django v5.1 Documentation.

### To Run the project:
1. Create a virtual environment & `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python manage.py migrate`
3. `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create an Admin User.
4. `python manage.py runserver` to run the project
5. The application will be served at either `127.0.0.1:8000/polls` or `localhost:8000/polls`
6. Use `/admin` to access the Admin Interface.
